 //Reguest is a built in function in Node.js .We pass 2 arguments to it. 1st our url. 2nd is a callback function
 //the callback function getts called with the response

 req.end()
//In this callback we donÂ´t have acsess yto the compleat response body as we are using Node.js core module http.request() with out npm request library 
//We have to listen for individual chunks to come in,we have to listen to when they have all arived
//http data can be streamed in multiple parts
//The chunk data that commes back is a buffer      buffer= a sett of numbers
//we want to convert the buffer to niumbers so we 



//response.on() is a function that alows us to register a handler, 
//there are a few events we can regiser callback functions for, one of them is data, 
//1. We provide the event name as the 1st argument represented as a string. Ex response.on('data')
//2. We can provide the callback, thats going to fire when new data comes in, we get acses to that data through the first and only argument commonly called chunk
//  Response.on('data',(chunk)=>{})
//The data comming in can happen once or multiple times, we want to take the chunk/ all of the chunks and store it in a variable
//3. Figure aout when we are done, the end event     response.on('end',()=>{}) after that is's callback will run, It doesn't take any arguments

//Figuring out how we can gett the entire reponce body and parse it from a JSON to a JS object


//What we gett back from the request method is what you can reffer to as the request it self, this is why we store this information in a variable called req, on here ther is a method we can use
//req.end()   By calling end the program will see that we are done setting up our request and end() will be fierd off
